Very early work on a GitHub bot for linting. Uses Probot for GitHub webhook interactions.

## Testing

You'll want to use probot's simulation mode. This simulates a webhook request from GitHub, **but uses the live GitHub API**, so be careful. The fixture data included in the repo is from a test repository (rmccue/test-linter).

Note also that both a `.env` and private key are required. You can create your own GitHub App to get these, or ping me (@rmccue) to get the details for `hmlinter`.

Your private key should be saved as `private-key.pem`, and your `.env` should contain this:

```
APP_ID=5455
WEBHOOK_SECRET=development
```

To test a `push` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate push fixtures/push.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

To test a `pull_request.open` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request fixtures/pull_request.opened.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

To test a `pull_request.synchronize` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request fixtures/pull_request.synchronize.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

## Deployment

Currently working on setting up for Lambda. See [README.old.md]() for the old repo readme from https://github.com/tcbyrd/probot-lambda which contains (outdated) instructions.

## Todo

* Update `index.js` for probot updates
* Break `linter.js` up into more manageable pieces
* Bundle PHP binary for running on Lambda
* Run on Lambda
