Automatically run the [HM Coding standards](https://github.com/humanmade/coding-standards) on any repository.

## Installation

To enable on any repository on GitHub, simply [head to the app page](https://github.com/apps/hm-linter) and Install/Configure. You'll get an initial report as a new issue if you have any existing linting errors in your codebase.

Every repository is different, and you might want to customise the rules that the linter runs. Good news: you can do just that. hm-linter detects custom configuration files automatically, just create a `phpcs.ruleset.xml` file for phpcs or [`eslintrc.*`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#configuration-file-formats) file for ESLint.

See the [HM Coding standards](https://github.com/humanmade/coding-standards) documentation for how to configure specific rules.

**Note:** Custom configuration can only use rules/standards which hm-linter has available. This includes the HM Coding Standards as well as any dependencies of it (such as the WP Coding Standards).


## Development

hm-linter is a GitHub bot built on top of the [Probot framework](https://probot.github.io/). It runs on Lambda.


### Testing

You'll want to use probot's simulation mode. This simulates a webhook request from GitHub, **but uses the live GitHub API**, so be careful. The fixture data included in the repo is from a test repository (rmccue/test-linter).

Note also that both a `.env` and private key are required. You can create your own GitHub App to get these, or ping me (@rmccue) to get the details for `hmlinter`.

Your private key should be saved as `private-key.pem`, and your `.env` should contain this:

```
APP_ID=5455
WEBHOOK_SECRET=development
```

To test a `push` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate push fixtures/push.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

To test a `pull_request.open` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request fixtures/pull_request.opened.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

To test a `pull_request.synchronize` webhook:

```
node_modules/.bin/probot simulate pull_request fixtures/pull_request.synchronize.json ./plugin/linter.js
```

## Deployment

Currently working on setting up for Lambda. See [README.old.md]() for the old repo readme from https://github.com/tcbyrd/probot-lambda which contains (outdated) instructions.

## Todo

* Update `index.js` for probot updates
* Break `linter.js` up into more manageable pieces
* Bundle PHP binary for running on Lambda
* Run on Lambda
